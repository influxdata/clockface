# Panel Header

Panel Headers are best used to denote the title of a panel. They can be accessed via the single `Panel` import as a subclass.

### Usage
```js
import {Panel} from '@influxdata/clockface'

<Panel.Header>

  // Children

</Panel.Header>
```

### Customization

If a child is passed in it will appear on the right of the header. This is useful if you need a single action button associated with the panel.

### Example
<!-- STORY -->


<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
