# TextBlock

Text blocks are simply text contained within a block that follows the styling of form elements. They are useful in constructing "natural language forms", i.e. a form that reads as a sentence.

### Usage
```tsx
import {TextBlock} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```
```tsx
<TextBlock text="Howdy!" />
```

### Example
<!-- STORY -->

---

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
