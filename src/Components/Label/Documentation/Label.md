# Label

This component is for displaying Labels from the InfluxDB API but can be used in many ways.

### Usage
```tsx
import {Label} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```

### Examples

Label changes based on what props are passed in. If `onDelete` is passed in the delete button appears. If `onClick` is passed in the entire label becomes clickable and highlights on hover. Both of these props can be passed in simultaneously.

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
