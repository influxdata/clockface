# ConfirmationButton

This is a composed combination of `Button` and `Popover` that offers a standardized way of having the user confirm a potentially dangerous action. By requiring a second click, and having the second click target offset from the base button, the user is highly unlikely to go through with the action accidentally.

### Usage

```tsx
import {ConfirmationButton} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```

### Example

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
