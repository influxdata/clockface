# Visibility Input

Visibility Inputs are a way to obscure data in an input field. A toggle icon appears to the right of the field which, when clicked, switches the input type between text and password.

### Usage

```tsx
import {VisibilityInput} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```

### State

By default `visibile` state is handled internally. If you want to manage that state externally then use the `visible` and `onToggleClick` props to override internal state.

### Example

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
