# Toggle

Toggle is an abstraction of regular HTML Radio and Checkbox inputs. Since they have almost identical usage patterns, they are grouped in a single component. Use the `type` prop to determine which one you want.

### Usage
```tsx
import {Toggle, ToggleInputType} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```

### Accessibility

Toggle is tab focusable and offers keyboard interactions. While focused, hitting `Enter` will toggle the `checked` state, and `Escape` unfocuses the Toggle.

### Example
<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->
