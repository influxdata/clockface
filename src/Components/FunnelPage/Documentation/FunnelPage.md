# FunnelPage

Funnel pages are designed to guide a user through a funnel (aka focused workflow) with minimal distractions. For this reason there is no navigation (beyond the optional logo) and the content is scaled up with the assumption that the copy will be minimal. While the background colors of the page are customizable we recommend sticking with the defaults to adhere to InfluxData brand guidelines.

### Usage

```tsx
import {FunnelPage} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```
```tsx
// Recommended usage:
<AppWrapper type="funnel">
  <FunnelPage>
    <h2>I am a title!</h2>
    <h5>I am a sub-title</h5>
  </FunnelPage>
</AppWrapper>
```

### Example

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
