# Dropdown Divider

DropdownDivider is part of the Dropdown component family and can be accessed from the single import. This element receives most of its styles from being a child of `<Dropdown.Menu />`.

### Usage
```tsx
import {Dropdown} from '@influxdata/clockface'

<Dropdown.Divider />
```
If the `text` prop is left empty the divider will render as a thin horizontal line.

### Example
<!-- STORY -->


<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
