# OverlayFooter

The footer of an overlay is for presenting a set of actions (usually represented by buttons) that the user can take in response to the overlay. While you could place buttons inside `<Overlay.Body />`, the footer has special styling rules that make action buttons look nicer and easier to grok.

### Usage
```tsx
import {Overlay} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```
All components in the `Overlay` family can be accessed from the single class import
```tsx
<Overlay.Footer>
  // Action buttons go here
</Overlay.Footer>
```

### Example
<!-- STORY -->


<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
