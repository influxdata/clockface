# NotificationDialog

This component is generated by `Notification` based on its props and visualizes the notification content.

### Usage

```tsx
import {Notification} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```
```tsx
<Notification.Dialog>
  TEXT
</Notification.Dialog>
```
While it is possible to use this component independently of `Notification` you will lose the positioning and animations.

### Customization

You can pass in a `backgroundColor` or `gradient` to control the colorization of the panel. If both props are passed in the `gradient` prop will override the `backgroundColor` prop.

### Example

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
